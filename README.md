# ledger-case-study

A starter project for the Ledger case study. Please feel free to modify or discard any parts of this project.

This starter is _not_ meant to be production ready and may ignore best practices for the sake of brevity.

## Repository structure

* The `api` directory contains a minimal Django REST Framework API server.
* The `app` directory is a placeholder for the frontend project.
